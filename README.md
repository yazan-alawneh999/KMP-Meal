## Architecture

The app follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **Data Layer**: API services, repositories, and data models
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic, use cases, and domain models
- **Presentation Layer**: UI components, ViewModels, and state management

### Key Components

- **ViewModel**: Manages UI state and business logic
- **Repository**: Handles data operations and caching
- **Use Cases**: Encapsulate business logic
- **State**: Immutable data classes for UI state
- **Events**: User actions and system events
- **Actions**: Navigation and side effects

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Hedgehog or later
- Kotlin 1.9.0 or later
- JDK 11 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later (for iOS development)
